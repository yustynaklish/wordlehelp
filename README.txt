This project helps me decide which words to guess when playing Wordle.
Wordle is a simple word guessing game that can be found here:
https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

With each guess, new restrictions on the letters in the word are revealed. My code filters the word list based on those restrictions.
This code was just made for personal use between my friends and I, and as such I haven't made it with user friendliness in mind (although that is a potential next project).
